I am a Master's student at the University of Washington studying Electrical Engineering. I'm interested in a variety of topics ranging from robotics and digital design to computer vision and machine learning.

During my undergrad, I worked as part of the GRID Lab under Professor Larry Sorensen to study the effects of electrical brain stimulation and presented my findings in the Undergraduate Research Symposium. I have also worked as an undergraduate researcher in the Silicon Systems Research Lab under Professor C.-J. Richard Shi, where I investigated various reinforcement learning algorithms and problem spaces for ASIC machine learning acceleration.

I also mentored students of the Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering (now the Center for Neurotechnology) Young Scholars Program.
